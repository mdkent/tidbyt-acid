# How where these files created?

This is on OSX:

* First we downloaded an artpack from http://artscene.textfiles.com/acid/ARTPACKS/ and extract the files.
* Next install [Ascension](https://github.com/ansilove/Ascension) to view the ANSI `.ans` files.
* Open each file in Ascension and and export them to PNG. Save them to the `originals/` folder.
* Run `brew bundle` to install any deps.
* Run `./prep-image-data`
