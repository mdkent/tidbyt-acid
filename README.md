# Tidbyt - ACiD Packs

This repo installs 4 random pieces of ACiD BBS ANSI art (of 99) onto your Tidbyt. These scroll
veritically and run for 15 seconds.

This work was sourced from http://artscene.textfiles.com/acid/ARTPACKS/ between 1992 and 1996.

# Setup

```
brew install
```

# Usage

It's recommend you cron this roughly every 5+ minutes. I've had a number of issue with the Tidbyt
crashing when images were pushed too frequently.

```
./push-gifs <device id>
```
